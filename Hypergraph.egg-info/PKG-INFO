        ==========
        
        The style guide I think it would be best to use is pep8: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
        
        You can get the style checker here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8
        
        You can get an auto formatter here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/
        
        
        Testing
        ---------
        
        Tests go in `tests/`.
        
        Run tests with `python setup.py test`.
        
        Test runner depends on
        [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html).
        
        Travis CI checks for pep8 compliance on all code. 
        
        If your code doesn't meet pep8 compliance the test suite will report a failure.
